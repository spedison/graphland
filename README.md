This example is about use of use of Graph.

1) Load Graph and convert it in String to understand the graph.
2) Load Graph from File
3) Search One Item in graph resulting a path of search.
4) Find maximum of possibilities paths in Graph for find one Node.
5) Appling Dijkstra Algorithm for find minimun length path while find one Node.

In base Classes as Node,Edge and Graph so make unit tests.

Use, learning and have fun.

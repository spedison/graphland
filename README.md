2) Load Graph from File
3) Search One Item in graph resulting a path of search.
4) Find Max os possibilities paths in Graph for find one Node.
5) Aplly Dijkstra Algorithm for find minimun path length to find on Node.

In base Classes as Node,Edge and Graph so make unit tests.

Use, learning and have fun.
